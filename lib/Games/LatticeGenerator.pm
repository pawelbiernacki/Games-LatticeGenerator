	}
	else

=head2 create_a_random_model

Creates a model of the given class, calculates the scales of all the sheets, chooses the smallest scale
and saves the sheets into PNG files.

=cut

{
	my ($this,$class) = @_;

	my $model = $class->new(

	my @scale = ();
		
	push @scale, $this->calculate_the_scale_of($model, $_) for 1..$$model{amount_of_sheets};

	carp "failed to scale the lattices ".join(",", map { defined($_) ? $_ : "undef" } @scale) if grep { !defined($_) } @scale;
	
	
	@scale = sort grep { defined($_) } @scale;
	croak "no scale" unless defined($scale[0]);

	$$this{scale} = $scale[0]*0.9;
	
	GD::Image->trueColor(1);
